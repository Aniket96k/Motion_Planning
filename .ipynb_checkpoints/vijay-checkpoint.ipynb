    "RRT and its variants produce a graph that approximates a continuous space, typically for the purpose of motion planning in high dimensional domains where complete (and optimal) methods fail. Adding difficulty to this problem is the fact that it is rare for our robot platforms to be holonomic, meaning that their mechanical degrees of freedom completely cover the degrees of freedom of the environment they operate in and the order of motor actuations does not have an impact on final position. For this reason, it is common to use sampling-based algorithms like those in the RRT family in two ways:\n",

    "1. Waypoints: Assuming a holonomic robot, use RRT to provide a sequence of intermediate environment position goals for the robot on the way to the goal state, which the robot will reach by employing a separate controller (e.g., assume holonomic with the use of a PID controller or other local planner)\n",

Before we jump into the main algorithm, we need to add code to implement the general-purpose ```get_nearest_vertex``` and ```steer_holonomic``` functions (any valid implementation will do). Within your ```rrt``` implementation, a function named ```steer``` is passed in that you will use for the algorithm.
